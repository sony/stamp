# Stamp

Stamp is an approval request workflow management tool that facilitates the submission, approval, and revocation of requests. It monitors the status of each request and initiates subsequent workflows upon approval.

Currently, it offers workflows for IAM Identity Center and IAM Role permission elevation and can be extended with custom integrations.

## Features

- Manage approval requests (submission, approval, and revocation)
- Approve requests via web interface or Slack
- Integrate with other systems through custom code
- Track and trigger downstream actions following approvals

## Predefined Approval Workflow Catalogs

Stamp organizes approval workflows into **Catalogs** based on integrations. Each Catalog is located in the `/catalogs` directory and includes configurations for specific approval processes.

| Catalog Name        | Description                                                                                       | Path                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| IAM Identity Center | Manages and elevates permissions using AWS IAM Identity Center seamlessly.                        | `/catalogs/iam-idc`  |
| IAM Role            | Handles temporary IAM Role permissions with integrated approval steps and supports GitHub's OIDC. | `/catalogs/iam-role` |
| Custom Integrations | Extends Stamp by integrating with other systems through customizable workflows.                   |                      |
